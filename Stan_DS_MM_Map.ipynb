       "      <td>Hi Miracle Messages team!\\n\\nMy name is Uma Mahto and I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego. I majored in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics and minored in Design and Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation. This past quarter for my Design class I worked on a final project trying to help tackle basic needs insecurity and the needs of the homeless population. In fact, we even sent an email earlier in April/May about collecting some primary research and data for the project. That was when I came across your internship postings. Now that I'm home in the Bay, I want to continue working on problems that really matter and make a big impact.\\n\\nOut of the 8 opportunities listed, 6 really speak to me as being a potential good fit. Given my background in computer science  and data analysis through bioinformatics, both the technical intern and data program intern role are ones I could see myself taking on. This technical background with my interests in design also make the design intern role one I could see myself in. However the roles that interest me the most are the general program intern, digital detective, and find them program intern. I think this is because of my desire to be more involved with the organization and people. I think I would be a really good fit for the general program intern role and would be able to learn a lot while maximizing my contribution to the organization. \\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you and about other ways to get involved! Also if you're interested, here's the link to my final presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CDZ9y8Jd1rr38fadbV4RpqqkQjexpdbo_U6GnP3oqSY/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\nBest,\\nUma</td>\n",

I've worked as a volunteer for three years at the Downtown Women's Center on Skid Row, where the motto is \"Every Woman Housed.\".  My sense is that re-housing our homeless population is the first and foremost best way to address this condition.My life long town, Santa Monica, has for many decades been referred to as \"The Home of the Homeless\" and our residents are reaching now critical mass in protest as homelessness keeps increasing here as everywhere else. Many of our current residents are fairly new to homelessness and at wits end not knowing how to proceed. I'm interested in bringing your organization and approach to the attention of our city leaders as they are putting forth attempts yet falling short in many ways in addressing the situation. Your approach is the most logical and practical in my estimation and I think if instituted here (we have lots of money!) it could very well be a shining beacon for expansion of Miracle Messages throughout the USA and beyond. I'm going to attend a community forum tomorrow. I'm not impressed that the instruction to business owners and residents is to \"show up and be ready to listen and ask questions\" as there is no room indicated for a well-rounded discussion that includes suggestions from residents. Please let me know your thoughts on this and I'm happy to be involved in bridging Miracle Messages to the City. My sense is it could be very successful! Thank you,Melissa Ward</td>\n",

During high school I had the chance to work with Regina Evans working to combat the human trafficking issue rampant in Oakland.  That summer I noticed that a root cause of women forced into the sex trafficking business, is poverty and homelessness.  Our approach then was to hire victims of trafficking and offer them employment as well as a creative means (in forms of live performances) to express and heal from their suffering.  \\nRecently I took a course on human trafficking and felt rather frustrated at the theoretical discussions with no real applications to help mitigate the issue.

I believe that the work that Miracle Messages does is very necessary and inspiring. My own family are all Khmer Rouge genocide survivors. On their way to America, most of them lost connections to their family and had absolutely no way of reconnecting.

       "5722  Hi Miracle Messages team!\\n\\nMy name is Uma Mahto and I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego. I majored in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics and minored in Design and Entrepreneurship & Innovation. This past quarter for my Design class I worked on a final project trying to help tackle basic needs insecurity and the needs of the homeless population. In fact, we even sent an email earlier in April/May about collecting some primary research and data for the project. That was when I came across your internship postings. Now that I'm home in the Bay, I want to continue working on problems that really matter and make a big impact.\\n\\nOut of the 8 opportunities listed, 6 really speak to me as being a potential good fit. Given my background in computer science  and data analysis through bioinformatics, both the technical intern and data program intern role are ones I could see myself taking on. This technical background with my interests in design also make the design intern role one I could see myself in. However the roles that interest me the most are the general program intern, digital detective, and find them program intern. I think this is because of my desire to be more involved with the organization and people. I think I would be a really good fit for the general program intern role and would be able to learn a lot while maximizing my contribution to the organization. \\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you and about other ways to get involved!

I've worked as a volunteer for three years at the Downtown Women's Center on Skid Row, where the motto is \"Every Woman Housed.\".  My sense is that re-housing our homeless population is the first and foremost best way to address this condition.My life long town, Santa Monica, has for many decades been referred to as \"The Home of the Homeless\" and our residents are reaching now critical mass in protest as homelessness keeps increasing here as everywhere else. Many of our current residents are fairly new to homelessness and at wits end not knowing how to proceed. I'm interested in bringing your organization and approach to the attention of our city leaders as they are putting forth attempts yet falling short in many ways in addressing the situation. Your approach is the most logical and practical in my estimation and I think if instituted here (we have lots of money!) it could very well be a shining beacon for expansion of Miracle Messages throughout the USA and beyond. I'm going to attend a community forum tomorrow. I'm not impressed that the instruction to business owners and residents is to \"show up and be ready to listen and ask questions\" as there is no room indicated for a well-rounded discussion that includes suggestions from residents. Please let me know your thoughts on this and I'm happy to be involved in bridging Miracle Messages to the City. My sense is it could be very successful! Thank you,Melissa Ward   \n",

I live and work in St. Petersburg, FL, and have been looking for an opportunity to affect, long term, the challenges our significant homeless population faces.  That your organization's goal is 1) faith-based/humanizing, 2) practical, and 3) solution-centric is captivating.  I'm very interested in learning more: have you been able to expand outside of the SF bay area, the logistics of doing so, etc.Thank you so much,~gwenn   \n",

During this school year at Stanford I have become jaded with academia and felt the urge to be doing hands-on service.  During high school I had the chance to work with Regina Evans working to combat the human trafficking issue rampant in Oakland.  That summer I noticed that a root cause of women forced into the sex trafficking business, is poverty and homelessness.  Our approach then was to hire victims of trafficking and offer them employment as well as a creative means (in forms of live performances) to express and heal from their suffering.  \\nRecently I took a course on human trafficking and felt rather frustrated at the theoretical discussions with no real applications to help mitigate the issue.  I imagine this internship would be a great way to start on a grassroots and community level.  I want to make change and feel like the work I'm doing amounts to impactful differences for other people.   \n",

I'm currently a college student at Stanford, but am from San Francisco. I received information about these opportunities in an email, and as a first income low generation college student, I really want to spend my summer doing something meaningful rather than trying to work at a big company like most of my peers are. I have a lot of experience in data analytics, researching, and other computer work, and definitely have the capacity to do these jobs. Some of my family and family friends have been homeless, so this organization hits close to home for me. I really hope to avoid becoming detached from how people live in the real world from being in college like I see a lot of other students are. In all, I would really love to be involved in any capacity possible, especially through the program intern positions. Please let me know if there is any way I can help out! I'm also a Bay Area local so transportation would not be so much of a problem.   \n",

My name is Jessica Seng. I am currently a junior at Stanford University studying Science, Technology, and Society (concentration in media and communications) and Creative Writing. \\n\\nI am extremely interested in the program internship with Miracle Messages. For the past two summers, I've been lucky enough to work for start-ups that had incredible impacts (one that worked on remedying food insecurity and the other that was dedicated to getting women back into the workforce after career breaks) and I hope to continue the trend. I believe that the work that Miracle Messages does is very necessary and inspiring. My own family are all Khmer Rouge genocide survivors. On their way to America, most of them lost connections to their family and had absolutely no way of reconnecting. I witnessed first hand what the loss of community can do to humans and I want to be part of a team that helps create networks of support. \\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. I'd love to talk more to the team and would be happy to send along a resume that highlights my qualifications. You can reach me at jbseng@stanford.edu or 520-235-1594. \\n\\nWarmly,\\nJessica   \n",

We have a lot of encampments here and some of my former clients are among those making the trek from Skid Row eastward. I'm originally from the Midwest and have a well connected group of people that have helped me identify people from the Ohio River Valley in the past as well. I'm a doctoral psychology candidate, so I also have some connections to the mental health/social services staff in East LA county.  Love to help, let me know where I can be of best use. Email or text is probably the best way to reach me.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJessica Han   \n",
